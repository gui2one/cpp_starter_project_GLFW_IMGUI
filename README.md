# Starter project
simple c++ starter project using glfw3, GLAD and ImGui.

GLFW and ImGUI are included as git submodules in src/vendor directory.


## cloning

when cloning this git repo, don't forget to use :

    git clone https://github.com/gui2one/cpp_starter_project_GLFW_IMGUI --recurse-submodules
 

## ImGui

ImGui (OpenGL3 implementation) for the UI.
Also I use the docking branch of ImGui. It seems to work very well
